# cub3d
Raycasting project in C (Linux) to honor Wolfenstein 3D's John Carmack and John Romero.

## Features
Roam around pre created mazes or create your own by editing the ```.cub``` file. I did my best to comment the whole code in order to help anybody who might be trying to achieve the same results. 

## Usage:
First clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/leorapini/cub3d.git
```
In the root folder run make:
```
make
```
Run the program by typing:
```
./cub3d ./maps/1.cub
```
There are other maps in the folder. My favourite one is ```2.cub```. You may also create new maps by simply following the same file structure and making any adjustments you wish. Remember to save the file as ```*.cub```.
