# libft
Why use pre-built C functions when you can write them yourself?

## Motivation

Part of the 42 cursus (42 École / 42 São Paulo), libft is my own personal library of C functions I have either re-written or created. 

## Features

Many, **many**, many functions, from string manipulation to memory addressing. And it has its own fancy ass Makefile! Includes get_next_line function.  


## Technologies

  - C
  - Makefile

 
## Room for improvement
  
  - Clearly I don't master the art of commenting commits.
  - Many similar functions weren't written with the same logic. I don't like it. I like pretty things.
